Adaptive Deep Learning through Visual Domain Localization
---------------------------------------------------------

### Repository for my Master Thesis (Work in Progress)

### Abstract:
The goal of Domain Adaptation is to minimize generalization error in those cases where the
i.i.d. assumptions do not hold. In the context of computer vision, and image recognition
in particular, there can be a variety of factors that influences the shift between
training and test distributions: background, lighting conditions, resolution, translation, scale,
and so on. These factors can have a dramatic impact on test performance.
Deep learning technologies, despite the many breakthroughs produced in recent years
in both academia and industry, suffer from the domain shift problem.
We designed a technique to extend Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to minimize
generalization error in the case of domain shift.
In particular, our method performs best when the causes of the shift are
object transformations--such as translation and scale. We show that our proposed technique outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across a number of benchmark datasets and baseline network architectures.
